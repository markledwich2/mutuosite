If you are an alien, you might not be aware that IT and Service Management (ITSM) is experiencing disruptive change. The cloud, software as a service, automation and decentralization are creating some fundamental changes to what IT does and the way work is done.

Understanding the underlying principles of decision making improves our ability adapt and take advantage of the opportunity that a crisis allows.

Are you trying to apply existing ITSM best practices to DevOps process? Do you call decentralized purchasing of software &quot;Shadow IT&quot; and try to enforce your role as gatekeeper? If so then you are not adapting. Another way to understand it by looking at flawed but typical decisions other people have made and try to learn the right lessons from them.

These are the most common ways I see poor decisions being made in IT. Decision makers often:

- Try to eliminate uncertainty rather than adapting to it
- Trust experts and intuitions too much - especially their own
- Use data and analytical methods in the wrong situations

Once you get the basic idea of complex systems then I will download a decision-making app into your necktop. I use specific examples where things have gone wrong, not to ridicule, but to be fun and for the ideas to stick.

## Complex Systems

A [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems) is one with a high level of uncertainty and where cause and effect can only be evaluated in retrospect. It has behaviour that is difficult to predict because it has many interacting parts (e.g. users, agents, processes) that are influenced by their environment, each other and the state they are in when a change is made. Someone&#39;s social network is an example of a complex system.

 ![](/images/decisions/social.jpg)

IT staff have a mixture of simple and complex work. Most management decisions and some projects are complex.

In ITSM, a **change** is complex or uncertain when:

- it is a change to a complex system
- key influencing factors are uncertain (e.g. competitive landscape, complex project costs)
- there are multiple subjective measures and different stakeholders

Indications that a **project** is complex:

- requirements are not able to be defined in detail
- tasks are novel or involve technology selection
- success relies on user behavior or multiple subjective measures

For decisions and processes that affect complex systems, this means

- There often no best practice, just good ones.
- Processes and success from others don&#39;t necessarily work for you and you don&#39;t know if they work until you try them
- Decisions with large impact should be trialled in a way that is safe to fail
- You should prioritize people, accountability and communication over processes and plans
- Estimates can&#39;t be relied on. Time &amp; Cost constraints don&#39;t make a project more complex. But the tighter they are, even small amounts of complexity might cause failure.


## Situational Decision Framework

When choosing how to approach decisions, the most important aspects to consider are system type and time.

System type:

- **Simple** : All information is known; the situation is stable and the relationship between cause and effect is obvious. E.g. gears on a bike

- **Complicated:** There are experts that can analyse using best practices and provide answers with a known level of certainty. They can make plans and stick to them and find optimal solutions. E.g. tax minimization for a business, or the mechanics of a plane

- **Complex** : The precise outcome of actions is only known in retrospect. Experts disagree and can&#39;t make predictions or stick to plans. There are &quot;unknown unknowns&quot;. E.g. entrepreneurship, software development

Time:

- **Short** : Only a short amount of time is used to decide. This can be because there are time constraints that force you to decide (e.g. who do I save in the burning building?). It can also be because it just isn&#39;t worth spending much time on (e.g. how much spare notebook should we keep in the office?)

- **Long** : More time is used to decide because there aren&#39;t short time constraints and it is worth spending more time to decide (e.g. what is the optimal flight path from Brisbane to Los Angles?)

This is similar to the popular [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) framework but considers time and additional options in situational decision making.

There are some nuances to these classifications

- They can change. Parts of complex system can be merely complicated as you are able to understand and predict them. (e.g. short-term weather forecasts)
- Any one decision can involve aspects to it that may be classified differently.

The next sections will overlay the best approaches onto these categories:

## Intuition

<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/intuition.png" data-action="zoom"  />

[Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman), [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/), [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) and others highly respected in cognitive science have demonstrated that we don&#39;t have the intellectual prowess and rationality that we have assumed. We are closer to a basket of [deplorable irrationality and deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias).

We are unknowingly plagued by [overconfidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), [limited attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_bias), [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) and other failures in judgement. We [create stories to explain the past](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201612/what-is-narrative-bias) in a way that fundamentally contradicts the complex randomness of the world and the uncertainty of future events. [We](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) [attribute success and failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) to people&#39;s ability [based on outcomes that were out their control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=885531).

Because we [can&#39;t introspect our irrationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion), our logical self acts as a   [full-time apologist](http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_bleu06.html) for our irrationality.

![](/images/decisions/monkey.jpg)

It is enough to think that we should give control to artificial intelligence as soon as possible. But all is not lost (yet), [Garry Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_A._Klein) and others show how human intuition and simple rules can work well, and in fact better than the slow rational methods in some situations. Many of our flaws are just good shortcuts used in the wrong environment.

Appropriate use of intuition:

- When you have a short feedback loop for failure, and in when actions have predictable outcomes (i.e. a [high-validity environment](http://www.chrissnijders.com/eth2012/CaseFiles2012/Kahneman,%20Klein%20-%202009%20-%20Conditions%20for%20intuitive%20expertise%20a%20failure%20to%20disagree.pdf))
- With [sufficient practice and talent](http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Macnamara-et-al.-2014.pdf)
- When presented with information [in the right way](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC200816/)
- If you have not been demonstrably [beaten by an algorithm](https://hackernoon.com/meta-article-on-the-discussion-about-decision-making-algorithms-d9640d900170) for this decision/task
- To explore and select possible options and use in combination with other methods

Examples: Life-saving surgery, Customer service, Business Strategy

If we don&#39;t get timely feedback then our &quot;gut&quot; has no chance to learn. We need clear, short term feedback. Otherwise, [our gut decisions might be more about how hungry we are](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3084045/).  This is one reason why algorithms are better than judges at determining parole and now used widely.

About [1 in 10](https://www.spglobal.com/our-insights/SPIVA-US-Scorecard.html) active stock managers beat the equivalent indexes over the last 10 years. Evaluating your performance over long periods is not something that we can do intuitively. Academics have been telling this since the 70&#39;s and it was only after the 2008 financial crisis that people started to notice. Low feedback environments and other cognitive biases are the reasons why fund managers can still think they are helping their customers by actively trading when aren&#39;t.

![](/images/decisions/monopoly.jpg)

An example in ITSM would be to improve agents gut feel about the best way to respond to tickets. Automatically asking for customer satisfaction and feeding it back to agents as soon as it is given will improve their intuitive decision making.

### Data visualization for intuition
Data visualization that is designed well improves our intuitive decision making. Some basic rules of thumb:

- Exclude irrelevant information, especially if it is known to cause unwanted bias. E.g. remove names when marking tests or reviewing resume&#39;s
- Simplify as much as possible
- Readily available and up to date

For example, consider the following description of best cancer screening.

_The probability of breast cancer is 1% for a woman who participates in routine screening. If a woman who participates in routine screening has breast cancer, the probability is 80% that she will have a positive test result. If a woman who participates in routine screening does not have breast cancer, the probability is 9.6% that she will have a positive test result._

This is the same information in a table with &quot;natural frequencies&quot;:

![](/images/decisions/natural-frequencies.png)

How likely are you to have cancer if you test positive?

Participants answered correctly only 5% with probabilities and 42% when visualized as natural frequencies.

Doctors were asked a similar question and [only 25% answered correctly](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28166019).

![](/images/decisions/doctor.png)

Our intuition is not very good with statistics but is better with natural frequencies. In this case, the right data visualization can save lives.



## Heuristics &amp; rules of thumb
<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/heuristics.png" data-action="zoom"  />
We use simple rules and heuristics to save time and effort. They allow for flexibility in uncertainty by avoiding the rigidity of analysis and the variability and bias or pure intuition. [Gigerenzer shows us](http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Why_2008.pdf) that the right rules can even out-perform sophisticated models in a wide variety of scenarios. Their simplicity means people remember them and apply them without much mental effort.

[Hollnagel&#39;s  work](http://erikhollnagel.com/ideas.html) shows us that development of heuristic requires deep analysis, and actions/decisions required a trade-off between thoroughness and efficiency.

Appropriate use of heuristics &amp; rules of thumb:

- [in uncertainty](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/chair-of-sociology-dam/documents/icsd2013/0_3_gigerenzer.pdf)
- to save time
- when an [appropriate heuristic](http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Why_2008.pdf) available
- as a second opinion for intuition or analytical methods

Examples: Investments, triage of patients, [Entrepreneurship](https://globaljournals.org/GJHSS_Volume12/7-Effects-of-Experience-on-Applying-Entrepreneurial.pdf)
### Heuristic use case – software project estimates

My best experience using heuristics has been with estimating projects. The best method for estimating when developing strategies (i.e. at the start of many possible projects) was not to double down on additional details and the dependencies and allocation of tasks.

Rather it was to get high level tasks estimated independent by different experienced developers, followed by a discussion and consensus. This estimate was then adjusted using a simple formula (which is a form of [reference class forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_forecasting)):

_Consensus estimate_
X
_Ratio of prior estimates to actual release time_

Recording estimates, scope and actual time of past projects allowed us to use a simple calculation at the start of a project that turned out to be more predictive than any other method. This method was quicker and more accurate compared to the more detailed and complicated methods we had used before.

### Heuristic use case – public infrastructure forecasts
![](/images/decisions/utopia.jpg)

Here are some recent tunnels and bridges that have been built in Brisbane and the [estimates vs actual](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gap-between-brisbane-tunnel-expectations-and-reality-continues-to-widen-20170309-guuj75.html) numbers of vehicles per day.

| Tunnel/Bridge | Estimated | Actual 2016 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clem7** | 67k | 33k |
| **Go Between** | 18k | 13k |
| **Airport Link** | 221k | 58k |
| **Legacy Way** | 31k | 21k |


It is hard to overstate how bad this is. On average, we received a 118% overestimate, which means that an estimate of 0 traffic (100% underestimate) is more accurate.

It cost $2.5 million to forecast the [Clem7 traffic](http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/clem7-tunnel-forecaster-maunsell-aecom-gains-indemnity/news-story/39dc3121e06b797ee7b9452a42697830?sv=4aaf9715af10c013bcc5593aa68604b0). The company used complicated models with &quot;hundreds of assumptions&quot;.  Other companies were paid to forecast the Airport Link with [similar approaches](http://www.veitchlister.com.au/services/demand-forecasting/toll-road-demand-forecasting).

The models are complicated and impressive, but the research shows forecast for similar projects have [large errors with a bias for overestimating toll collections](http://atrf.info/papers/2011/2011_Davidson.pdf). We knew in 2010 that on average, actual traffic for toll roads are 45% below forecasts, but we still paid for them and took them at face value.

If we had adjusted the estimates based on this knowledge of bias we would have had the following adjusted estimates. Much closer!


|   | Estimate | Bias Adjusted | Actual 2016 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clem7** | 67k | 37k | 33k |
| **Go Between** | 18k | 10k | 13k |
| **Airport Link** | 221k | 122k | 58k |
| **Legacy Way** | 31k | 17k | 21k |


But why pay for poor performing forecast in the first place? Reference class forecasting [was already being used in the US and UK](http://peakconsulting.dk/Portals/0/media/PMO-forum/23-nov-2011/Flyvbjerg_2008_CurbingOptimismBiasAndStrategicMisrepresentationInPlanningReferenceClassForecastingInPractice.pdf) because of its simplicity and ability to mitigate bias. When adopted in the UK, some projects were even cancelled based on the drastically different estimates.

### Forecasting recommendations

Making predictions is becoming more common in ITSM, but be careful that you aren&#39;t being fooled. It is important to use industry accepted heuristics to make forecasts or use them to sanity check more sophisticated ways of modelling. When evaluating forecasts, ensure:

- The forecaster should have the incentive to produce an accurate forecast. There is so much room for biases in models that the forecaster be free from perverse incentives
- The forecasting model has a history of prediction where there is recorded estimates before the outcome is known
- To test the model on events that are not known to the forecaster. This can either be as a trial for some future event or on prior events that they have not trained their model on. Be careful, as they will show you how well they can predict prior events. Anyone can train their models to do this and is not evidence that their model works
- If there are proven heuristics for making predictions. Use these instead, or as a second opinion on more complicated forecasts

### Data visualization for heuristics

For heuristics, it is important that you have the relevant information available and can calculate it quickly when needed.

Selection of which heuristics to show, and how much importance is placed on them will influence decisions. Just by displaying a heuristic that is no important may negatively influence decisions.

The wrong heuristics will have a negative impact, so it is a good idea to review and question the heuristics being shown. Cognitive flaws like the [framing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)) and [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) mean that we should be careful how heuristics are framed (e.g. absolute cost, cost compared to budget or cost compared to option B).

## Analytical methods

<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/analytical.png" data-action="zoom"  />

Most professional jobs are within this domain and it is the processes and types of decision making you are used to (e.g. ITIL).

Appropriate use of analytical methods:

- If enough time to analyse, and of enough consequence
- If you have not been demonstrably [beaten by an algorithm](https://hackernoon.com/meta-article-on-the-discussion-about-decision-making-algorithms-d9640d900170) for this decision/task

Examples : Accounting, Civil Engineering, Logistics

### Data visualization for analytical methods

Analytical methods lend themselves to all the typical ways of processing and visualizing data.

Reports, dashboards, what if analysis, predictive models all help with making decisions in these systems.

This is a huge topic that needs to be covered at in depth separately. This is also the method I believe people in IT have a natural inclination for, so I don&#39;t want to distract from the other approaches.

## Action

<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/action.png" data-action="zoom"  />

This for chaotic situations, when there is little time and events are unpredictable. It is best to take action, bring order and start to make sense of the situation. There is no time to take input or achieve consensus, you must make decisions and give orders.

An example of a chaotic system in ITSM would be if a floor of the office with servers was flooded. It is best to act and delegate quickly ensure critical services are restored. Consensus building, finding optimal solutions and cost savings are less important than doing anything that might work.

It is appropriate to use a combination of intuition, heuristics and rules. It is also iterative; the important aspects of the situation must be continually assessed.

[M Omodei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mary_Omodei) (who has many published papers on decision making in fireifghting) generously provided the following diagram. It shows us the common &quot;error traps&quot; we are likely to make in complex, chaotic situations.

<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/error-traps.png" data-action="zoom"  />

By understanding these common cognitive errors, especially with specific examples in our field we can be more resilient to falling into these traps.

Examples : Combat, Firefighting, Emergency Surgery

### Data visualization for action

Real time, relevant, simple lists or measurements are critical. Usually, only a few pieces of information that are indispensable (e.g. the list of servers affected by the flood, the heart rate and arterial blood pressure for someone under general anaesthetic).

Make sure metrics are automated and available where you need them. You aren&#39;t going to have time to be playing with exports from your ITSM systems in excel.

## Iteration
<img class="img" src="/images/decisions/iteration.png" data-action="zoom"  />
Iterative methods are best used in complex environments when you have enough time to probe, analyse the results and respond.

As opposed to approaches in the complicated domain:

- Changes are made in shorter iterations
- Planning is reactive, adaptive
- Roles blur
- Requirements change
- It is better to aim [satisfactory solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) rather than the optimal ones
- Mistakes will be made. Set aside regular times to [reflect and self-criticize](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpqNq6ttrVAhWLGpQKHbGSAE4QFghFMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F227822819_Errors_in_Planning_and_Decision-making_and_the_Nature_of_Human_Information_Processing&amp;usg=AFQjCNFN90D3fBOXMvuNduwmqtrRFV845g) without judgement

The software industry has widely adopted [agile](http://www.agilenutshell.com/how_is_it_different) processes because it works better in the uncertainty and complexity of that domain.

Examples : Software Development, TV &amp; [radio programming](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/04/agile-social-cheap-the-new-way-npr-is-trying-to-make-radio/)

### Use Case - ITIL vs Developer Operations

Clashes between developer operations and IT are because of different ways of approaching problems that have evolved over time to suit their respective domains.

[Industry experts](https://purplegriffon.com/blog/is-itil-agile-enough), and organizations like [ING](https://www.slideshare.net/JanJoostBouwman/itil-and-devops-can-be-friends?next_slideshow=1) have incorporated agile approaches into organizations with ITIL. This should give you hope that these methods can work together if you haven&#39;t started this journey already.

I&#39;ll give you a telling example of the approach difference that gets to the core difference of assumptions.

![](/images/decisions/maturity-model.png)

The maturity Model pictured is from a slide in a [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/siddharth4mba/it-service-management-and-improvement-framework) on ITIL. It shows how confident some are that uncertainty can be eliminated. The maturity model puts organizational maturity on a level in a hierarchy. The &quot;steps of certainty&quot; at the bottom right tells us that if only we could know enough and have the best processes, documentation and coordination then we can finally eliminate uncertainty and become &quot;mature&quot; as an organization.

If you are working in a complex system, then you should, in fact, be doing some of the things at level 1 on this ladder. You should spend less time on process management and formal documentation activities, reacting to changes and adjusting your plans.

I&#39;m not trying to convince you to always use agile approaches or that this slide is a fair representation of CMMI. I am saying that &quot;mature&quot; organization will use appropriate processes and approaches according to the situation.

### Use Case - Brisbane City Council&#39;s LGS Project


![](/images/decisions/bcc.png)

Avoidable failures occur in projects because we treat complex systems as complicated. The council where I live has a project to replace 13 existing systems (e.g. rate paying, development assessment). It is [not going well](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/technologyone-could-lose-122m-brisbane-council-deal-448721). The contractor says that the council keeps changing the goal posts, and the council says that the partner is the cause of the 18 month $60m AUD overrun.

There were problems with the approach to this project before the engineering work even started:

- Small projects were combined into larger ones
- They used the tender process. Requirements were specified, companies submitted proposals with costs, and the winner was selected
- Estimates were used to forecast cost savings 10 years into the future



This might have been appropriate if this was a [typical tender](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/about-council/governance-strategy/business-brisbane/business-opportunities/selling-council/tender-opportunities) but the council&#39;s software project is a complex system. It has many interacting parts, a variety of stakeholders with different motives, and requirements that were not able to be fully specified.

Combining smaller projects is a risky strategy even for just complicated projects. With a complex system, it is better to break things down into small iterations, have more releases, and adjust to changes as required. To reduce the difficulty users, have with too many frequent changes, release changes to subsets of early adopters and group together those release to the wider audience.

Requirements for a complex system cannot be specified up front without significant change. What makes things harder is that this is exactly what is required in the tender process. As a result, the initial contract may seem good value, but higher rates are charged for work that is not scoped at the beginning. We treat this so called &#39;scope creep&#39; as a failure of the person responsible for correctly identifying all requirements, or that the scope added after the start is inherently less valid.

I suspect that technology companies submit proposals for these tenders knowing the likely outcomes. I feel sorry for the engineers working on these projects when things aren&#39;t going to plan and for the rate payers who paid too much.

Someone entrenched in the complicated approaches will see the same reasons for failure but never overcome them (e.g. a lack of requirements, lack of process, poor risk management, lack of requirements and planning). Others see the issue but are trapped within a system where some of this approach is written into law (e.g. the [City of Brisbane Act 2010](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CityBrisA10.pdf)).

### Data visualization for iteration

All methods of visualization are relevant, however compared to complicated systems there should be

- Less focus on predictive and optimization models
- A higher priority on key metrics and explorative analysis

Metrics of success are outcomes rather than completing plans. Metrics are used to provide goals with the greatest possible autonomy given to the team.
